# InVAErt networks: a data-driven framework for emulation, inference, and identifiability analysis

InVAErt networks are designed to perform emulation, inference, and identifiability analysis of physics-based parametric systems.

For additional information, please refer to the publication below:

[InVAErt networks: a data-driven framework for emulation, inference and identifiability analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12586), Guoxiang Grayson Tong, [Carlos A. Sing-Long Collao](https://www.ing.uc.cl/academicos-e-investigadores/carlos-alberto-sing-long-collao/), and [Daniele E. Schiavazzi](https://www3.nd.edu/~dschiava/).

## Please stay tuned for the more Jupyter Notebook tutorials!

#### Note: the Jupyter notebooks are created for illustration purposes thus the hyper-parameters are adjusted for swift and efficient execution. For more accurate results, we recommend running the code locally with fine-tuned hyper-parameters.
